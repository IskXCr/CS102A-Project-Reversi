    Welcome to Reversi!

    This is a very interesting chess game.

    There are sixty-four (Or you might want more. We allow you to customize.) identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line or 45 degrees line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

    The objective of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display one's color when the last playable empty square is filled.

    If you are still not sure enough, place a new chess on the lighted grid in the tutorial chess board. And see what would happen!
